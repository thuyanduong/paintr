# Paintr App 

We are going to be studying this starter code in order to prep for our lesson on React Router. A valuable skill to build up is being able to understand starter code. Run this app on your local computer and answer the Short Response Questions below.

## Set Up

This app uses a React front-end and a JSON Server mock back-end. 

### Back-End

Inside the project, run `json-server data.json --port 4000` to start the RESTful JSON Server. If you don't have JSON Server installed, install it using `npm install -g json-server`.

Check that your server is up and running by visiting http://localhost:4000/paintings

### Front-End

Open up another temrinal tab. Inside the project, run `npm install` to download dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the App.
